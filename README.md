# hello-world
First repository for ideas and files
I'm an old man learning new tricks with a desire to create something new and helpful.  I will collaborate with anyone willing to take a chance of a true novice.  I'm trying to teach myself how to code using SWIFT (currently via Palyground on my iPad), Python, and anything else that I can readily understand, to effect positive change in my life and in as many lives as possible.  
COMMIT message for this change: Entered my most general objectives for learning to code.
